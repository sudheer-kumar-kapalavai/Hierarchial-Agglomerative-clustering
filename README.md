# Hierarchial-Agglomerative-clustering
Hierarchical clustering is one of the unsupervised machine learning algorithms, which is used to group the unlabeled datasets into a cluster and also known as hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA.

In this algorithm, we develop the hierarchy of clusters in the form of a tree, and this tree-shaped structure is known as the dendrogram.

Sometimes the results of K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering may look similar, but they both differ depending on how they work. As there is no requirement to predetermine the number of clusters as we did in the K-Means algorithm.


The hierarchical clustering technique has two approaches:

Agglomerative: Agglomerative is a bottom-up approach, in which the algorithm starts with taking all data points as single clusters and merging them until one cluster is left.

Divisive: Divisive algorithm is the reverse of the agglomerative algorithm as it is a top-down approach.

Why hierarchical clustering?
As we have seen in the K-means clustering, there are some challenges with this algorithm, which are a predetermined number of clusters, and it always tries to create the clusters of the same size. To solve these two challenges, we can opt for the hierarchical clustering algorithm because, in this algorithm, we don't need to have knowledge about the predefined number of clusters.
